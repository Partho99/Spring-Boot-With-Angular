# Spring-Boot-With-Angular

I used my spring boot project  spring-boot-news-portal as backend server which is also in git repositories (https://github.com/Partho99/Spring-Boot-News-Portal).

NOTE: I am not a frontend developer i am just trying to integreting this angular project to my spring boot projects

I use  Angular CLI: 9.1.1
